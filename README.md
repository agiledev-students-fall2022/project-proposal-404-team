### Project title

MyDreamInternship

### What and why?

It is a platform for students to find internships at FAANG companies, create applications, track them, and look for open vacancies in dream companies. Currently many students even don't know how to search for companies and apply for them. The applying process includes visiting a company website and looking for requirements and open vacancies. And in case you are applying for bunch of companies, you have to iterate the process bunch of times for each company. Students' applications are scattered in different places like Google Doc, Notes, etc. Hence, there is no structure in facilitating applications and it takes a lot of time to handwrite the application from scratch; thus it is inefficient.

### For whom?

(Worldwide) University students

### How?

The user will see a list of top tech/hedge-fund companies where they can select a company and see the requirements and deadlines and open vacancies. Then a person can add the company to the wishlist. The wishlist page is the place where a person can start filling the application with already filled data that will be fetched from person's CV or manually entered profile data. Many applications share the same data requirement so the person has to provide the profile data only once and it will be pasted to every application. For each application the person will be able to change its status (not started, in-progress, applied, accepted, rejected).
