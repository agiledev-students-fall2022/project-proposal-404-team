### Project title

Automated Course Scheduling System

### What and why?

Students spend time each semester designing several options of their schedules before the actual registration on Albert and thus this project
would be a time-efficient way to develop the course schedule without much effort.

### For whom?

NYU students

### How?

The students must be able to choose courses
The students must be able to see course description
The students must be able to see course availability
The students must be able to see different options of a schedule
The students must be able to change some of the courses

### Scope

There is a time constraint with that the system should be done and running in the next 2 months and there is a techinal constraint that it should be supported by all commonly used operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Linux) but luckily we will full stack development and thus the aim is tangible.
